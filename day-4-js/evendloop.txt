Event Loop - 

javascript is a single thread programming language it means that javascript can do only one thing at a single point in time.
the event loop is the secret behing javascript's asynchronous programming.
the event loop has one simple job - to monitor the call stack and callback queue
if the call stack is empty, then the evel loop will take the first event from the event queue and will push it to the call stack.
