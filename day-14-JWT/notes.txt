JWT tokens - (JSON web tokens) 
            -  self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
               This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

JWT has 3 parts: 
1. header - algorithm and type of tokens
2. payload - Date(encode)
3. signature - secret(application stored) + algorithm keyword (base64)

Base64 - Base64 is a binary to ASCII encoding scheme.
        It is designed as a way to transfer binary data reliably across channels that have
        limited support for different content types.
        Base64 characters only use the same 64 characters that are present in most character sets.

Middleware : The middleware in node. js is a function that will have all the access
            for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware
            function in the application request-response cycle.

Next : The next function is a function in the Express router which,
       when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
       Middleware functions can perform the following tasks: Execute any code.
       Make changes to the request and the response objects.
